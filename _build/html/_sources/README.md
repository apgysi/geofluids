This project aims at building a book about introduction in geochemical modeling. The book url is https://apgysi.github.io/geofluids/ This book is part of a class Geofluids
that will be taught this Fall at NMT and also aims at covering the basics of geochemistry of fluid-rock interaction including thermodynamics of fluids and minerals, reaction kinetics, and much more. The book is available for free open access to allow students to learn and broaden their horizon in geochemistry.
