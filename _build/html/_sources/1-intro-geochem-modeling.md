# 1-Introduction to Geochemical Modeling
## What is geochemical modeling?

Geochemical modeling is a tool that can be used to interpret fluid-rock interaction in natural geologic systems. Throughout this book we will cover different types of models and refine this definition with a focus on fluid-rock reaction path modeling. In essence, these models are based on thermodynamics and focus on the evolution of chemistry of fluids (water and gases) and mineralogy and can be linked to physical models to understand porosity, permability, and fluid flow networks. 

Primary rock-forming minerals dissolve, solutes form aqueous species, and secondary minerals become saturated. The modeler understand what controls the formation of alteration zones, what affects the mobility of elements, and the factors influencing the evolution of geofluids. All these

## The 5 steps to geochemical modeling?
**Slide Title: 5 Steps to Geochemical Modeling Mastery**

**(Step 1) Define:**
- **What's the problem?** Clearly state your research question or the issue you want to address.
- **Set the scene:** Describe the geological environment (rock types, fluids, temperature, pressure).
- **Gather clues:** Collect and assess relevant data (water chemistry, minerals, maps).
- **Example:** CO2 sequestration in basalts – what happens when we inject CO2 into basalt rock? What data do we need to understand this process?

**(Step 2) Equip:**
- **Choose your tools:** Explore different geochemical modeling software (PHREEQC, Geochemist's Workbench) – each has pros and cons.
- **Find good data:** Accurate thermodynamic data is crucial. Learn about different databases (EQ3/6, SUPCRT92).
- **Get started:** Learn the basics of your chosen software and how to input data.

**(Step 3) Understand:**
- **Aqueous Speciation:** How do dissolved chemicals behave in water? Understand activity, ionic strength, and speciation diagrams.
- **Mineral Solubility:** Will minerals dissolve or precipitate? Learn about solubility products, saturation indices, and activity diagrams.
- **Redox Reactions:** Electron transfers can significantly impact the system. Eh-pH diagrams are your friends!
- **Reaction Kinetics:** How fast do reactions occur? Explore factors that influence reaction rates.

**(Step 4) Construct:**
- **Build your model:** Translate your research question into a conceptual model with key processes and parameters.
- **Reaction Path Modeling:** Simulate how the system changes over time due to fluid-rock interaction.
- **Check your work:** Calibrate and validate your model by comparing it to real-world data.

**(Step 5) Apply & Predict:**
- **Go further:** Explore advanced techniques like reactive transport modeling.
- **Real-world predictions:** Use your model to understand complex scenarios like ore formation or the long-term impacts of CO2 sequestration.
- **Make an impact:** Apply geochemical modeling to solve real-world problems and contribute to our understanding of Earth processes.

## Define the problem & conceptualize it into a model

- **1.3 Define: Conceptualization & Problem Definition**
    - Clearly defining the research question or problem
    - Identifying the relevant geological context (e.g., rock types, fluid compositions, temperature, pressure)
    - Gathering and evaluating existing data (e.g., water chemistry, mineralogy, geological maps)
    - **Real-world example:** Introduce the CO2 sequestration into basalts case study. What are the key questions we might ask? What data do we need?

Another test

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a test note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
