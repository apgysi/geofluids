Another test

Here is a "note" directive:

```{note}
Here is a test note
```

It will be rendered in a special box when you build your book.

Here is an inline directive to refer to a document: {doc}`markdown-notebooks`.


## Citations

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
```
