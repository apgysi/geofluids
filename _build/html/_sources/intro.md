# Geofluids: Your 5-Step Guide to Mastering Geochemical Reaction Path Modeling

![cover](./images/Krisuvik-Iceland.jpg)

The overall objectives of these accompanying Geofluids course notes are to:
- give you a systematic step wise approach to problem solving using geochemical modeling
- use real-world case studies to gain an understanding of key processes controlling fluid-rock interaction
- refresh fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic concepts and give you a solid understanding of their importance for modeling 
- guide you in designing, calculating, and plotting fluid-rock equilibrium and kinetic models 
- get you started on your own modeling projects!

Useful materials for the exercises includes the [GEMS Tutorial gitbook](https://apgysi.github.io/gems-mines-tutorial/) and the [MINES thermodynamic database](https://geoinfo.nmt.edu/mines-tdb) .

This book is split up into several chapters that will be added and improved step by step.
